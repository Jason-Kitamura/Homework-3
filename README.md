This password generator homework was the most challenging thus far. Personally, I found that it was a good practical example for using javascript, however it was not easy, stress inducing, and required a good amount of assistance to get started. Coming out of it, I feel much more confortable in reading and writting javascript. 

I formatted my password generator in a way that I thought was user friendly, yet still possible to make with my java skills lol.. 

First the user is prompted to enter a number from 8-128 to represent the character length of their password. If an invalid number or NaN is entered, the user will get a respective message and be sent back to enter an appropriate answer.

Next the user must select the checkboxes to include what type of characters they want to include in their password 

    - lowercase
    - uppercase
    - numbers
    - special letters

After the boxes are selected the users can then hit the generate button and their custom password will pop out. If no boxes are selected, then the user will get an alert 'Please check (atleast 1) type of character to use' and no password will be generated.
